## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design with media queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I improved my skills in responsive design and practiced using Flexbox to create flexible layouts. I also learned how to use media queries to adapt the design for mobile devices, and how to apply smooth hover animations to interactive elements.

Here’s a snippet of the hover animation I implemented for the interactive links:



### Continued development

I want to continue practicing advanced CSS animations and transitions, as well as improving accessibility for interactive components. I also plan to explore using CSS Grid for more complex layouts in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - Helped me understand Flexbox properties.
- [Frontend Mentor community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Great for feedback and inspiration.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Reference for Flexbox layouts.
